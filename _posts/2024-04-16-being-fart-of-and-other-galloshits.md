Most of you have probably no idea about it (do you even now there is in this
world a Catalan language?), but anyway… There's a _kyul_ expression in that
language: _estar fart de_ (being "stuffed" of) which comes from latin _fartus_
with same meaning. It has nothing to relate to your regular english fart, but we
could totaly use that one as a mnemotechnical metaphore to explain it.

Now, imagine you are being _farted_ at by a gazillon of shit particles (we'll
assume you are not scatophile). This is really annoying, isn't it? This is more,
that's _so annoying_ that you are _getting mad_ about it. This is it. You're
_fart_ of that much bullshitting, that you're getting mad about it.

The french have something similar to tell you when they are _farts_: they have
it _ras le cul_. I guess, they mean they are filled up full of shit. So much,
that's really annoying and it urge them to get ride of all that poop.

If you want some more poop stuff, just look at a Catalan representation of the
nativity of the christ: there's probably some _caganer_ (shitter) hidden
somewhere doing its stuff. So typical of the Cacatalans.

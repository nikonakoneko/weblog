They wanted a King to rule over them; They have been warned against; Still, they
wanted a Ruler like others nations.

Then, their leader made them worship the flag of Zion; for the flag they were
brought to fight like beasts; So they lost their humanity as they forgot the
Word of their true and Only God.

Then they defied the other kingdoms; And now, the offended Kings want to punish
them for their offence.

The beasts will suffer, as will the ones that are still human; this is
unavoidable, because _tikkun olam_.

The kingdom of Zion shall burn; and so shall the many kingdoms born from the
World of Tohu.

Only when the Kings will be left with no followers, will the people be able to
achieve and transcend the World of Tikkun.
